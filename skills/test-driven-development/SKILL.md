# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

## When to Use

**Always:** New features, bug fixes, refactoring, behavior changes.
**Exceptions (ask your human partner):** Throwaway prototypes, generated code, configuration files.
Thinking "skip TDD just this once"? Stop. That's rationalization.

## The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over. Don't keep it as "reference". Don't "adapt" it while writing tests. Don't look at it. Delete means delete. Implement fresh from tests. Period.

## Red-Green-Refactor

### RED - Write Failing Test

```typescript
test('retries failed operations 3 times', async () => {
  let attempts = 0;
  const operation = () => {
    attempts++;
    if (attempts < 3) throw new Error('fail');
    return 'success';
  };

  const result = await retryOperation(operation);

  expect(result).toBe('success');
  expect(attempts).toBe(3);
});
```

**Requirements:** One behavior. Clear name. Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable).

### Verify RED - MANDATORY. Never skip.

Run tests. Confirm: (1) test fails (not errors), (2) failure message is expected, (3) fails because feature missing (not typos).

**Test passes?** You're testing existing behavior. Fix test.
**Test errors?** Fix error, re-run until it fails correctly.

### GREEN - Minimal Code

Write simplest code to pass the test.

```typescript
async function retryOperation<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (e) {
      if (i === 2) throw e;
    }
  }
  throw new Error('unreachable');
}
```

Don't add features, refactor other code, or "improve" beyond the test.

### Verify GREEN - MANDATORY.

Run tests. Confirm: (1) test passes, (2) other tests still pass, (3) output pristine (no errors, warnings).

**Test fails?** Fix code, not test. **Other tests fail?** Fix now.

### REFACTOR - Clean Up

After green only:
- Remove duplication
- Improve names
- Extract helpers

Keep tests green. Don't add behavior.

## Good Tests

| Quality | Good | Bad |
|-|-|-|
| **Minimal** | One thing. "and" in name? Split it. | `test('validates email and domain and whitespace')` |
| **Clear** | Name describes behavior | `test('test1')` |
| **Shows intent** | Demonstrates desired API | Obscures what code should do |

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|-|-|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. You never saw it catch the bug. |
| "Already manually tested" | Ad-hoc ≠ systematic. No record, can't re-run, can't prove edge cases. |
| "Deleting X hours is wasteful" | Sunk cost fallacy. Keeping unverified code is technical debt. |
| "Keep as reference, write tests first" | You'll adapt it. That's testing after. Delete means delete. |
| "TDD is dogmatic / I'm being pragmatic" | TDD IS pragmatic: finds bugs before commit, prevents regressions, enables refactoring. "Pragmatic" shortcuts = debugging in production = slower. |

## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- Test after implementation
- Test passes immediately
- Can't explain why test failed
- Rationalizing "just this once"
- "Keep as reference" or "adapt existing code"
- "Already spent X hours, deleting is wasteful"
- "This is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**

## Example: Bug Fix

**Bug:** Empty email accepted

**RED**
```typescript
test('rejects empty email', async () => {
  const result = await submitForm({ email: '' });
  expect(result.error).toBe('Email required');
});
```

**Verify RED**
```bash
$ npm test
FAIL: expected 'Email required', got undefined
```

**GREEN**
```typescript
function submitForm(data: FormData) {
  if (!data.email?.trim()) {
    return { error: 'Email required' };
  }
  // ...
}
```

**Verify GREEN**
```bash
$ npm test
PASS
```

**REFACTOR:** Extract validation for multiple fields if needed.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Every new function/method has a test
- [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing
- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason (feature missing, not typo)
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Output pristine (no errors, warnings)
- [ ] Tests use real code (mocks only if unavoidable)
- [ ] Edge cases and errors covered

Can't check all boxes? You skipped TDD. Start over.

## When Stuck

| Problem | Solution |
|-|-|
| Don't know how to test | Write wished-for API. Write assertion first. Ask your human partner. |
| Test too complicated | Design too complicated. Simplify interface. |

Bug found? Write failing test reproducing it. Follow TDD cycle. Never fix bugs without a test.
